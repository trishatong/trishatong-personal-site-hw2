            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Trisha Tong! I'm currently a senior at the University of California, San Diego 
                majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business. I have built a strong foundation 
                in software engineering through my education and project experience. My background 
                includes working with various programming languages, including Python, Java, and 
                JavaScript, and key software engineering principles (i.e. Agile). I also have 
                familiarity with environments and tools like Git and JUnit, and am continuing to learn 
                more about APIs (i.e. using Postman) and networking. Through collaborative and individual projects, 
                I have honed my ability to work effectively in both team-based and independent settings. 
                These experiences have helped me adapt to fast-environments and deliver quality software 
                solutions. I'm eager to join a company that will help me fulfill my career ambition to integrate 
                technology with human-focused solutions.</p>
